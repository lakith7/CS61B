All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A:I was proud about implementing a circular approach.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: I found that my resize function was inelegant (it was very long and didn't pass the quickness tests).

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: I learned that there is a way to make resize even more efficient.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: I wish I understood a circular approach better because I implemented it a lot late and I had to rewrite a lot of code.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I would write resize and resize_less better (maybe even combine them).

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I was proud of the sentinel node. It wasn't an easy concept to fully understand.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: I used a lot of code and could have condensed it a lot.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A: I learned that you can use ++ to denote adding one to a variable.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: I would have wanted to understand the sentinel node better.

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I would make sure to write a circular sentinel node from the beginning.

Meta:

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: I liked it. I learned a lot.
