Q: Can you think of an analogy between the process of tesselating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways? 
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?

A: Cant really think of a metaphor for those two processes.

-----
Q: If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tesselating hexagons.

A: I would probably start with a code block that initializes a space of certain length and height and enables
the player to set pixel/tile colors.

-----
Q: What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?

A: A hallway is a long room connected to a lot of rooms, while most
rooms are just connected to the hallway.

Q: For tesselating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way. 
After looking at your own implemention, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab. 
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?

A: The new implementaion differed by using more efficient code. I can learn how to make my code run faster.

-----
Q: Consider an algorithm for placing rooms and hallways on your map. 
Ideally, consider many algorithms and think about what makes some easier or harder to implement. Try and bring those ideas together into a single simple algorithm which accomplishes the task. 
In general, algorithms with as few edge cases as possible are better algorithms.

A: This isn't a question. I don't know what question to answer.
